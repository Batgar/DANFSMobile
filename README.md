# DANFSMobile
An initial Xamarin UI for iOS and Android that accesses geolocation data in a local SQLite database and JSON + XML hosted on S3.

The original data comes from the [DANFS] (https://github.com/jrnold/danfs) Github project.

The documents have been processed through another helper project to expose date, location, organization, and person information.
